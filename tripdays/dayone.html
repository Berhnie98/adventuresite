<h3>My first day of the trip!</h3>
<img src="../images/alarm-clock.png" alt="Day One">
<p> I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. 
Because I'm on a segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot 
with me:
<div>
<ul> 
<li>cellphone</li> 
<li>ipod</li> 
<li>digital camera</li> 
<li>a protein bar.</li> 
</ul>
</div>
Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, 
<q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step Segway.</q>
